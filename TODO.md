# Ragnarok TODO

Last updated: 2026-05-25

This is the single living todo for Ragnarok. Tasks stay here after completion and are updated with their status and fulfillment notes rather than being removed or replaced.

## Status scale

- `Open`: not started or still incomplete
- `In progress`: currently being implemented
- `Done`: completed and should remain documented here with fulfillment notes

## Priority scale

- `Critical`: blocks trustworthy project exchange or core modeling correctness
- `High`: major product gap or frequent user pain
- `Medium`: meaningful support expansion or UX improvement
- `Low`: polish or secondary capability

## Cost scale

`Estimated token cost` is a rough implementation budget for one focused coding pass, including reading, patching, verification, and light documentation. It is not a calendar estimate.

## Todo

| Status | Priority | Area | Task | Why it matters | Estimated token cost | Fulfillment / notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---|
| `Done` | `Critical` | Optimization capability | Add multi-investment / pathway planning support | This was one of the largest gaps between PyPSA and Ragnarok. | 35,000 | Fulfilled with an opt-in pathway mode, shared pathway config metadata sheets, backend multi-investment expansion into PyPSA, period-aware outputs/results, selected-period analytics, and a maintained sample workbook at `sample-networks/pathway_capacity_expansion.xlsx`. Polished in PR #15: pathway settings moved to a dedicated **Multi-year planning** sidebar group, planning-mode pill selector moved out of the run dialog, `_snapshots_index` / `_apply_ts_sheet` dedupe so single-period runs on pathway-style workbooks no longer hit "Reindexing only valid with uniquely valued Index objects", and the period selector switched to pill buttons matching the rest of the UI. |
| `Done` | `High` | Analytics | Add a capacity-over-investment-periods chart for pathway runs | Pathway users had no way to see how installed capacity evolves across the planning horizon. | 10,000 | Fulfilled in PR #16 + follow-ups: `CapacityByPeriodCard` renders a stacked column chart of total active capacity per investment period, grouped by carrier or by generator. Active capacity respects `build_year` / `lifetime`; extendable assets use `p_nom_opt`, fixed assets use `p_nom`. Driven entirely off `(model, outputs)` so it works on imported projects with no backend call. The new-additions/bin variants were removed in favour of letting the Capacity Expansion table below handle the "what was newly built" question. |
| `Open` | `Critical` | Project export/import | Retain the solved backend `pypsa.Network` or solved workbook artifact after a run | A solved-network artifact would complement the current pure-JSON path for users who want PyPSA-native round-trips (Python notebooks, downstream tooling). Current export is frontend-assembled from `results.outputs` — accurate but not the authoritative `pypsa.Network`. | 18,000 | Lower priority than originally scored: PR #9 made the JSON-cache round-trip lossless and PR #11 reconstructs a full `RunResults` on import without a backend call. Remaining gap is primarily for PyPSA-native interoperability, not Ragnarok-internal trust. |
| `Open` | `Critical` | Project export/import | Add Ragnarok metadata sheets for settings, constraints, run window, run history, and import provenance | Current project import restores more result metadata than before, but users still do not get the full project state back. | 20,000 | Result-oriented metadata is now partially covered by dedicated workbook sheets (`RAGNAROK_ResultMeta`, `RAGNAROK_PluginAnalytics`) for run metadata, pathway state, narrative, CO2 shadow, and plugin analytics. Remaining gap is full project-state restoration: settings, active constraints, run window, run history, and explicit import provenance. |
| `Done` | `Critical` | Project export/import | Switch project export/import to a pure-JSON pipeline driven by the PyPSA schema | The backend used to write an xlsx artifact then ship it back; this fought the schema and lost outputs on edge cases. | 22,000 | Fulfilled in PR #9: backend returns a schema-driven `outputs.{static,series}` cache; frontend assembles the project workbook locally by merging input rows with output static columns and appending output series sheets. Sidebar gains separate **Import Project / Export Project / Export Result** buttons; Demo button removed. |
| `Done` | `High` | Architecture | Derive per-asset detail records on the frontend instead of the backend | Per-asset details (generator outputSeries / busDetail / branchDetail / storage SoC) were Python-only, which prevented Analytics from working after an import and duplicated math vs the raw schema cache. | 15,000 | Fulfilled in PR #9 follow-up: `deriveAssetDetails` walks the cached `outputs` plus `model` carriers/colors. Backend `lib/results/assets/` removed. Plugins and Analytics now read from a single in-memory source. |
| `Done` | `High` | Import fidelity | Rebuild the full `RunResults` (summary, dispatch series, cost breakdown, carrier mix, nodal balance, line loading, merit order, emissions breakdown, expansion results, asset details) on the frontend when importing a project workbook | Imports previously left the Result tab empty unless the user re-ran PyPSA. | 18,000 | Fulfilled in PR #11 via `deriveRunResults`. Import also creates an `Import N` run-history entry so imported cases appear in the sidebar and Comparison tab. `co2Shadow` remains the one field that needs a fresh solve. |
| `Done` | `Medium` | Reporting | Add an HTML "Export Report" action that emits a self-contained shareable result file | Users wanted a one-click way to share or print a run summary without sending an xlsx. | 8,000 | Fulfilled in PR #12: standalone .html with inline CSS + inline SVG (stacked-area dispatch, system price line, emissions line), KPI cards, cost breakdown, expansion, merit order, nodal balance, line loading, emissions breakdown, and the solver narrative. No external scripts. |
| `Done` | `Medium` | Architecture | Schema-drive run-history counts and the backend "Imported model" log line | The last hardcoded component lists in IO-adjacent code. | 4,000 | Fulfilled in PR #10: `RunHistoryEntry.componentCounts` is now `Record<string, number>` populated by walking `SHEETS`; backend log iterates `network.components.keys()`. New PyPSA components flow in automatically after a schema regen. |
| `Open` | `High` | Optimization capability | Add rolling-horizon optimization workflow | PyPSA supports rolling-horizon style operation, but Ragnarok only supports a single static solve window today. | 18,000 | |
| `Open` | `High` | Optimization capability | Add stochastic optimization support | PyPSA supports two-stage stochastic planning; Ragnarok has no scenario or uncertainty model. | 30,000 | |
| `Open` | `High` | Optimization capability | Add security-constrained optimization / SCLOPF workflow | Important missing transmission-planning capability for serious network studies. | 24,000 | |
| `Done` | `High` | Import fidelity | Restore plugin analytics and non-derivable solve metadata on project import | Imported projects currently lose plugin analytics and CO2 shadow information. | 10,000 | Fulfilled in the import-metadata follow-up PR: project workbooks now carry `RAGNAROK_ResultMeta` and `RAGNAROK_PluginAnalytics` sheets, and import restores `pluginAnalytics`, `co2Shadow`, `runMeta`, `pathway`, and solver narrative without any backend round-trip or plugin re-execution. |
| `Open` | `High` | Validation | Expand validation from common electricity checks to schema-aware coverage | The input schema is broad, but validation still focuses on buses, loads, generators, lines, and links. | 12,000 | |
| `Open` | `High` | Data platform | Add location-based wind and solar profile generation/import | Users should be able to choose a location and populate renewable profiles without preparing time series manually. This needs source selection, caching/database design, and workbook write-back into PyPSA time-series sheets. | 22,000 | |
| `Open` | `High` | Data platform | Add a renewable/weather profile database layer | Location-based profiles should not be one-off fetches only. Ragnarok needs persistent storage or cache/indexing for reusable wind/solar resources by location, year, and source. | 18,000 | |
| `Open` | `High` | Data platform | Add national-level starter model imports | Users should be able to import a prebuilt country-scale baseline model instead of constructing one workbook from scratch. | 24,000 | |
| `Open` | `High` | Data platform | Add a source registry for national models and profile datasets | National model import and profile generation need a managed catalogue of sources, versions, coverage, and provenance. | 16,000 | |
| `Open` | `High` | Optimization UX | Add scenario and multi-period run configuration UX | Multi-year and stochastic support are not useful without a first-class configuration surface. | 18,000 | Pathway side covered by the **Multi-year planning** sidebar group (PR #15); scenario / stochastic configuration UX is still open. |
| `Open` | `High` | Analytics | Add multi-period and scenario-aware result analytics | Pathway/stochastic support requires different result views, comparisons, and summaries. | 20,000 | Period KPI strip, period summary table, capacity-over-periods chart, and comparison-table pathway period rows are in. Cross-scenario analytics remains open as a separate problem from pathway-period comparison. |
| `Done` | `High` | Analytics | Add workbook-import restoration for more solve-derived metrics beyond current derivation set | Imported project analytics should match a fresh solve more closely. | 12,000 | Fulfilled in PR #11 — `deriveRunResults` rebuilds summary, dispatch series, cost breakdown, carrier mix, nodal balance, line loading, merit order, emissions breakdown, expansion results, and asset details from `(model, outputs)`. |
| `Open` | `Medium` | Workbook model | Add regression tests and docs for `network`, `shapes`, and `sub_networks` runtime behavior | The backend now imports these sheets, but the contract should be locked down with tests and documented clearly so it does not regress. | 7,000 | |
| `Open` | `Medium` | Components | Add dedicated result UX for `processes` | Backend and workbook support exist, but there is no analytics surface. | 12,000 | |
| `Open` | `Medium` | Components | Add dedicated result UX for `shunt_impedances` where useful | Currently workbook/backend only. | 8,000 | |
| `Open` | `Medium` | Types and standard types | Clarify and test `line_types` / `transformer_types` behavior end-to-end | These are currently mostly implicit/pass-through capabilities. | 7,000 | |
| `Open` | `Medium` | Constraints | Expand the custom constraint panel or better expose native `global_constraints` behavior | Constraint authoring is stronger in the workbook/backend than in the UI. | 9,000 | |
| `Open` | `Medium` | Testing | Add round-trip tests for `Save`, `Export Project`, `Import Project`, and `Export Result` | Current support is powerful enough that regression risk is now high. | 14,000 | |
| `Open` | `Medium` | Data platform | Add data-source health checks and provenance reporting | Imported profiles and national baseline models should expose where they came from, which version was used, and whether the source is still reachable. | 12,000 | |
| `Open` | `Medium` | Data platform | Add user-facing data import presets by country/region | A curated “import baseline model for country X” flow reduces setup effort and keeps national models consistent. | 14,000 | |
| `Open` | `Medium` | File formats | Support PyPSA CSV folder import/export in the UI | Useful for advanced users and larger cases. | 15,000 | |
| `Open` | `Medium` | File formats | Support netCDF/HDF5 workflows in the UI | Better aligned with PyPSA’s broader I/O model than Excel-only workflows. | 18,000 | |
| `Open` | `Low` | Analytics | Add a dedicated carrier-level analytics view | Carrier data exists indirectly today. | 6,000 | |
| `Open` | `Low` | Analytics | Add load drill-down analytics | Loads drive system metrics but do not have a first-class detail view. | 8,000 | |
| `Open` | `Low` | Documentation | Auto-generate the support matrix from schema + capability declarations | Reduces drift between code and docs. | 9,000 | |
| `Done` | `High` | Backend correctness | Apply the `network` sheet explicitly in backend network construction | The `network` sheet was editable and preserved but previously not used as a true runtime input. | 8,000 | Fulfilled by adding a shared `network` runtime import policy, applying `network.name`, `srid`, `crs`, and `now` explicitly during backend `pypsa.Network` construction, and removing Ragnarok-side skip filtering for schema-defined sheets other than the real special cases `network` and `snapshots`. |

## Suggested execution order

1. Retain solved backend network/workbook artifacts for PyPSA-native interoperability.
2. Finish full project-state metadata round-trip: settings, constraints, run window, run history, and provenance.
3. Add location-based renewable profile import and the supporting data registry/database layer.
4. Add national-level starter model imports.
5. Broaden validation and lock down sheet-import behavior with regression tests.
6. Add round-trip tests for project workflows.
7. Add rolling-horizon, stochastic, and security-constrained workflows.
8. Expand scenario-aware analytics and remaining component-specific result UX after the project exchange path, data layer, and core optimization modes are trustworthy.
