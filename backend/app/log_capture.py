"""In-process log capture for the Analytics → Log tab.

Attaches a single :class:`MemoryLogHandler` to the root Python logger so every
:mod:`logging` record (uvicorn access, application, exception tracebacks)
is mirrored into a thread-safe ring buffer. Surfaced via ``GET /api/log``.

What this **does** capture
--------------------------
* uvicorn HTTP access logs (``uvicorn.access`` logger).
* uvicorn errors / startup logs (``uvicorn.error``).
* Any application code that uses ``logging.getLogger(...)``.
* Unhandled exceptions routed through ``logging.exception()``.

What this **does not** capture (yet)
------------------------------------
* Solver C-stdout (HiGHS verbose dump). Capturing that needs file-descriptor-
  level ``os.dup2`` redirection on the run worker process. Listed as a
  follow-up — would require careful handling around the multiprocessing
  fork/spawn boundary so dev terminal output is not also swallowed.
* Direct ``print()`` calls in the backend. They go to stdout, not through
  ``logging``. The backend convention is to use ``logging.getLogger(...)``;
  any stray ``print()`` will be invisible to the Log tab.

Why a ring buffer
-----------------
The buffer is intentionally bounded (default 1000 lines) so a long-running
server cannot grow memory without bound. Oldest entries are silently
dropped as new ones arrive — the ``cursor`` field on each fetch lets a
client detect that drops occurred.
