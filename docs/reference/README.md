# Function Reference — Index

Per-module function reference for the Ragnarok backend and frontend.

Each file documents every public and important internal function in its module group: signature, one-line purpose, parameters (with units where physical), return value, and a note on logic and role.

| [frontend-utils.md](frontend-utils.md) | Utility hooks, formatters, and shared helper functions |

## Notes on scope

- This reference covers both the backend (`backend-*.md`) and the frontend (`frontend-*.md`). The system-level architecture overview is in [`../architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md); process logic is in [`../architecture/PROCESSES.md`](../architecture/PROCESSES.md).
- The solver used throughout is HiGHS. The only supported study mode is `"optimize"`.
- All monetary values in function signatures are in the currency configured by `options["currencySymbol"]` (default `"$"`); physical power is in MW; energy in MWh; emissions in tCO2e unless stated otherwise.
