# Ragnarok

Ragnarok is a local React + FastAPI application built on [PyPSA](https://pypsa.org) for:

- editing a PyPSA-style workbook
- running a PyPSA optimization with HiGHS
- reviewing results in a map, table, and analytics UI
- exporting either:
  - an input workbook
  - a full project workbook with solved PyPSA outputs
  - a result/report package for sharing

The current schema is generated from PyPSA GitHub metadata and checked into the repo at [src/config/pypsa_schema.json](/Users/sanghyun/github/pypsa_gui/src/config/pypsa_schema.json). The authoritative PyPSA references for this README are:

- [PyPSA Components](https://docs.pypsa.org/latest/user-guide/components/)
- [PyPSA Import and Export](https://docs.pypsa.org/latest/user-guide/import-export/)
- [PyPSA Optimization Overview](https://docs.pypsa.org/v1.0.2/user-guide/optimization/overview/)
- [PyPSA Pathway Planning / Multi-Investment Optimization](https://docs.pypsa.org/latest/examples/multi-investment-optimisation/)
- [PyPSA Stochastic Optimization](https://docs.pypsa.org/latest/user-guide/optimization/stochastic/)

## Scope

Ragnarok is not a full UI wrapper around every PyPSA capability.

The app has four different support layers, and they are not identical:

- `Workbook I/O`: can the app open, edit, and save the sheet/attribute?
- `Backend Run`: does the backend actually apply it when building/running `pypsa.Network`?
- `Project Export/Import`: can it round-trip through `Export Project` and `Import Project`?
- `Analytics UI`: does Ragnarok expose dedicated result views for it?

Support levels used below:

- `Full`: implemented end-to-end in the relevant layer.
- `Partial`: implemented with important caveats.
- `Implicit`: preserved or consumed through generic schema/workbook plumbing, but without dedicated UI or richer handling.
- `Not supported`: no active implementation path today.

## Architecture

Frontend:

- [src/App.tsx](/Users/sanghyun/github/pypsa_gui/src/App.tsx): app shell, run flow, workbook open/save/import/export, run history
- [src/constants/pypsa_schema.ts](/Users/sanghyun/github/pypsa_gui/src/constants/pypsa_schema.ts): generated PyPSA schema adapter for the frontend
- [src/shared/utils/workbook.ts](/Users/sanghyun/github/pypsa_gui/src/shared/utils/workbook.ts): workbook parse/save/project round-trip
- [src/shared/utils/deriveRunResults.ts](/Users/sanghyun/github/pypsa_gui/src/shared/utils/deriveRunResults.ts): rebuilds `RunResults` from imported workbook outputs

Backend:

- [backend/main.py](/Users/sanghyun/github/pypsa_gui/backend/main.py): FastAPI app and run lifecycle
- [backend/lib/network/__init__.py](/Users/sanghyun/github/pypsa_gui/backend/lib/network/__init__.py): schema-driven network builder
- [backend/lib/results/__init__.py](/Users/sanghyun/github/pypsa_gui/backend/lib/results/__init__.py): solve + analytics result assembly
- [backend/lib/results/full_outputs.py](/Users/sanghyun/github/pypsa_gui/backend/lib/results/full_outputs.py): schema-driven solved output extraction
- [backend/lib/pypsa_schema.py](/Users/sanghyun/github/pypsa_gui/backend/lib/pypsa_schema.py): backend schema helpers

## Current User Flows

`Open`

- opens a workbook into the in-memory model
- does not restore prior results

`Save` / `Save As`

- save input-only workbook content
- strip output attributes from component sheets
- keep input time-series sheets only

`Export Project`

- writes input workbook sheets
- merges solved output columns/sheets from `results.outputs` if a run exists
- does not currently include Ragnarok-specific metadata like settings, run history, plugin analytics, or backend solve state

`Import Project`

- parses workbook inputs
- parses solved PyPSA output attributes/sheets
- rebuilds a frontend `RunResults` object from workbook outputs
- does not restore original settings, constraints, plugin analytics, or CO2 shadow values

`Export Result`

- writes a result-oriented workbook with `OUT_*` sheets for reporting

`Export Report`

- writes a self-contained HTML report of the current result

## Support Matrix: Optimization Capabilities

This section is separate from workbook/component support because PyPSA’s
optimization envelope is broader than the workflow Ragnarok currently exposes.

| PyPSA optimization capability | Ragnarok status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Single-period optimization | `Full` | Main optimization mode today. |
| Economic dispatch with extendable assets | `Full` | Core solved workflow. |
| Capacity expansion planning, single investment period | `Full` | Extendable generators, storage units, stores, lines, and links are supported. |
| Storage operation with perfect foresight over the chosen horizon | `Full` | Supported within the currently modeled snapshot window. |
| Carbon pricing in the optimization objective | `Full` | Implemented as a marginal-cost adder. |
| Unit commitment / mixed-integer operation | `Partial` | Supported via generator attributes, but validation and analytics are still simpler than the full PyPSA capability set. |
| Force-LP dispatch mode | `Full` | Explicit Ragnarok run option. |
| Custom/global system-wide constraints | `Partial` | Useful subset implemented, but not the full optimization space. |
| Multi-carrier optimization | `Partial` | The backend can ingest multi-carrier workbook structures, but the UX and analytics remain electricity-centric. |
| Rolling-horizon optimization | `Not supported` | No backend orchestration or UI flow for rolling windows. |
| Multi-investment / pathway planning | `Not supported` | No support for `investment_periods`, period weightings, multi-index snapshots, or pathway result handling. |
| Stochastic optimization | `Not supported` | No scenario-tree, two-stage, or CVaR workflow. |
| Security-constrained optimization / SCLOPF | `Not supported` | No branch-outage or contingency solve path. |
| Scenario-based planning UX | `Not supported` | No first-class scenario manager or uncertainty workflow. |
| Multi-period result analytics | `Not supported` | Current analytics assume a single modeled horizon. |

## Support Matrix: PyPSA Features vs Ragnarok

| PyPSA capability | Ragnarok status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Excel workbook import (`Network.import_from_excel` equivalent user workflow) | `Partial` | Ragnarok opens Excel workbooks, but it parses into its own in-memory model instead of delegating import to PyPSA directly. |
| Excel workbook export (`Network.export_to_excel` equivalent) | `Partial` | `Save` exports inputs only. `Export Project` exports input + solved outputs, but not the full backend-solved network artifact or Ragnarok metadata. |
| Generic component schema sync from PyPSA GitHub | `Full` | Build-time generator populates [src/config/pypsa_schema.json](/Users/sanghyun/github/pypsa_gui/src/config/pypsa_schema.json). |
| Generic input table editing for documented components/attributes | `Full` | Input tables are schema-driven rather than hardcoded. |
| Generic backend ingestion of documented input attributes | `Full` | Backend uses schema-derived input static/time-series attributes in [backend/lib/network/__init__.py](/Users/sanghyun/github/pypsa_gui/backend/lib/network/__init__.py). |
| Generic solved-output extraction for documented PyPSA outputs | `Full` | Backend extracts schema-marked outputs in [backend/lib/results/full_outputs.py](/Users/sanghyun/github/pypsa_gui/backend/lib/results/full_outputs.py). |
| Input-only save/load round-trip | `Full` | Known PyPSA input sheets round-trip through [src/shared/utils/workbook.ts](/Users/sanghyun/github/pypsa_gui/src/shared/utils/workbook.ts). |
| Full project workbook round-trip | `Partial` | Solved outputs round-trip, but settings/history/plugin analytics/backend solve state do not. |
| Restore analytics from imported solved workbook | `Partial` | Frontend reconstructs most analytics locally, but not everything from a fresh solve. |
| Result workbook export for reporting | `Full` | `Export Result` keeps a dedicated reporting workbook. |
| HTML report export | `Full` | Implemented in [src/shared/utils/exportReport.ts](/Users/sanghyun/github/pypsa_gui/src/shared/utils/exportReport.ts). |
| Structural validation before solve | `Partial` | Validation is useful but still focused on common components and common failure modes. |
| HiGHS optimization | `Full` | Uses `network.optimize()` with HiGHS. |
| Carbon price adder | `Full` | Applied to generator marginal costs from carrier emission factors. |
| Capacity expansion for extendable assets | `Full` | Annualized CAPEX applied for extendable generators, storage units, stores, lines, and links. |
| Unit commitment / MIP | `Partial` | Supported through PyPSA/HiGHS generator attributes, but analytics and validation are still more dispatch-focused than UC-focused. |
| Force-LP override | `Full` | Supported in backend run options. |
| Custom constraints panel | `Partial` | Several custom constraints are implemented, but not the full PyPSA constraint space. |
| Rolling-horizon optimization | `Not supported` | No rolling-window orchestration in the backend or UI. |
| Multi-investment / pathway planning | `Not supported` | No support for `investment_periods`, period weightings, or pathway result handling. |
| Stochastic optimization | `Not supported` | No scenario-tree workflow or stochastic solve mode. |
| Security-constrained optimization | `Not supported` | No SCLOPF / branch outage workflow. |
| Native `global_constraints` workbook usage | `Implicit` | Sheet is available and passed through the generic network builder, but Ragnarok adds only limited dedicated UI/analytics around it. |
| Plugin execution pipeline | `Full` | `pre-build`, `post-build`, `in-solve`, `post-solve` stages are implemented. |
| Plugin analytics round-trip through project import/export | `Not supported` | Project workbook currently stores only PyPSA-shaped inputs/outputs, not plugin-specific analytics payloads. |
| CO2 shadow price restoration from imported project | `Not supported` | Fresh solve only; workbook outputs are insufficient for reconstruction in current code. |
| Backend retention of solved network/workbook | `Not supported` | Backend returns result JSON and derived output caches, but does not keep a solved `pypsa.Network` artifact for later export. |
| CSV-folder / netCDF / HDF5 workflows | `Not supported` | Ragnarok is currently Excel-first in the UI. |
| Power flow-only studies / separate PF UX | `Not supported` | Current workflow is optimization-centric. |

## Support Matrix: PyPSA Components

| Component / sheet | Workbook I/O | Backend Run | Project Export / Import | Analytics UI | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `network` | `Partial` | `Not supported` | `Partial` | `Not supported` | Editable/preserved in workbook, but not actively applied in backend network construction. |

| `generators` | `Full` | `Full` | `Full` | `Full` | Best-supported component class end-to-end. |
| `loads` | `Full` | `Full` | `Full` | `Partial` | Load drives system analytics, but there is no dedicated load drill-down UI. |
| `links` | `Full` | `Full` | `Full` | `Full` | Visualized as branches in analytics. |
| `lines` | `Full` | `Full` | `Full` | `Full` | Visualized as branches in analytics. |

| `shunt_impedances` | `Full` | `Full` | `Full` | `Not supported` | Generic workbook/backend support only. |
| `global_constraints` | `Full` | `Implicit` | `Full` | `Partial` | Workbook/backend support exists; result UX is limited. |

| `transformer_types` | `Full` | `Implicit` | `Full` | `Not supported` | Preserved and passed through, but no dedicated UX. |
| `shapes` | `Partial` | `Not supported` | `Partial` | `Not supported` | Exposed in tables and preserved in workbook, but not consumed by the backend. |
| `sub_networks` | `Implicit` | `Not supported` | `Implicit` | `Not supported` | PyPSA computes this; Ragnarok currently preserves sheet data rather than managing it as a live computed object. |

## Important Current Limitations

1. `Export Project` is workbook-driven, not backend-solved-network-driven.
   The app exports `results.outputs`, not a retained solved `pypsa.Network`.

2. `Import Project` restores only what can be inferred from workbook inputs and outputs.
   It does not restore:
   - settings
   - constraints configuration
   - run history
   - plugin analytics payloads
   - CO2 shadow prices
   - backend solve metadata

3. `network`, `shapes`, and `sub_networks` are not aligned cleanly across UI and backend.
   They are visible/preserved in the workbook layer, but they are not all active runtime inputs.

4. Validation is still selective.
   The schema is generic, but the validator remains focused on common electricity-model cases.

5. Ragnarok does not yet cover PyPSA’s broader planning modes.
   The largest optimization gaps today are:
   - multi-investment / pathway planning
   - rolling-horizon optimization
   - stochastic optimization
   - security-constrained optimization
   - multi-period analytics and scenario UX

## Development

Run locally:

```bash
./run.command
```

Key frontend commands:

```bash
npm run start:frontend
npm run build
npx tsc --noEmit
```

Key backend checks:

```bash
python3 -m py_compile backend/main.py backend/lib/network/__init__.py backend/lib/results/__init__.py
```

Regenerate the PyPSA schema:

```bash
npm run generate:pypsa-schema
```

## Repository Notes

- The frontend is intentionally Excel-first.
- The schema is generated from PyPSA GitHub metadata, but support in Ragnarok still depends on whether a feature is:
  - only preserved in workbook form
  - actively consumed by the backend
  - surfaced in analytics
- The most accurate way to read current support is the matrix above, not the presence of a sheet name in the schema alone.
